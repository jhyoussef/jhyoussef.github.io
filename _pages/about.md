I am a recent graduate interested in reconstructing paleoecologies through time. With quantitative modeling, phylogenetic study, and even art, I explore the dynamic system of lifeâ€™s history on and interactions with Earth.

I studied geosciences at the University of Chicago, where I also received a minor in Astrophysics, completed a number of art projects, learned to ballroom dance, and learned that soft pastel is one of my favorite mediums. Based in Hyde Park, I continue to do research in paleontology, blending my knowledge and computational skills from astrophysics, biology, and geology with my awe and wonder as a scientist, artist, and academic.

Right now, I am working on modeling the evolutionary history of pterosaurs, as well as a means of quantifying the relationship between mammalian dentition and diet through literature and fossil specimens. Both tackle the complicated relationship between the the real organisms, the evidence they leave behind, and the way we encode and model that evidence as data. I am particularly interested not just in the reconstruction of these organisms as moving parts within an ecological system, but also in examining the way we engage with them.

Additionally, I am working on using digital and traditional media to expand into scientific illustration, paleoart, and design, using visuals to reanimate extinct life as well as as a means to explore how the past can be communicated visually as well as scientifically.
